            I’m a developer who enjoys building smooth, efficient web applications and turning
            complex data into clear, actionable insights. I also love automating the tedious
            stuff—because tech should make life easier.
         </p>
         <p className='small'>
            With a focus on user experience and data-driven decision-making, I like creating tools
            that feel intuitive and help people work smarter. I thrive in fast-moving environments
            where I can solve real problems with well-designed solutions.
         </p>
         <p className='small'>
            Whether it's designing scalable systems, visualizing trends, or fine-tuning workflows,
            I’m always looking for ways to push technology forward in meaningful ways.
